Following on from various posts about scratches on the back of the iPhone 17 Air, I've heard about the technique using the eraser end of a pencil. Before trying this technique, can you confirm that there is no risk of damaging or lightening the matte coating on the back, as with polishing paste? Will the eraser damage the oleophobic coating on the back glass?

Basically, I want to make sure that pencil erasers are not considered abrasive, unlike the anti-scratch polishes that we use, which could lighten the matte back if we start polishing it.

Otherwise, I thought I saw that in the Apple Store, they used a mixture of water and salt to remove potential scratches. That seems even riskier than the eraser, doesn't it?

Reddit,2025-11-03T14:06:22.689688,iphone 17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Caudabe/comments/1onbs2u/replacement_buttons_are_shipping/,Replacement buttons are shipping!,"Great news is here for those who’ve experienced buttons that rattle excessively. 

Our manufacturing team was able to expedite the manufacturing of replacement buttons faster than we originally anticipated, and replacement buttons have begun shipping to customers who previously contacted our support team. And, even though excessive button rattling was primarily limited to certain early batches of Sheath for iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, all Sheaths for those two models manufactured starting last week are being fitted with these new buttons as well. If you’ve already reached out, you’re all set. Your request is in the queue, and you’ll receive a shipping confirmation once your replacement buttons are on the way. 

While the replacement buttons will fix excessive rattling, do note that a tiny bit of rattling when shaking your phone vigorously is normal. In order to function properly, independent buttons require a tiny amount of space within the button housing to move. In situations where the phone is being used normally and isn’t being shaken vigorously, any rattling should be nearly imperceptible even in a quiet room.  

Also, during testing, our team discovered that the buttons on iPhones themselves exhibit some rattling when shaken vigorously, for the same reasons mentioned above. This is also consistent with what we’ve seen on other phones, including the Samsung S25 Ultra. So if you still hear a little bit of rattling when shaking your phone vigorously, it’s likely the phone and not the buttons on the case.  

If you’re experiencing excessive rattling and you haven’t yet reached out to our support team, feel free to do so at your convenience. The replacements will be shipped to you at no cost, and you don’t need to return your case. 

Thank you again to everyone for your understanding and support throughout this process. ",caudabe,,Caudabe,great news is here for those who ve experienced buttons that rattle excessively our manufacturing team was able to expedite the manufacturing of replacement buttons faster than we originally anticipated and replacement buttons have begun shipping to customers who previously contacted our support team and even though excessive button rattling was primarily limited to certain early batches of sheath for iphone pro and pro max all sheaths for those two models manufactured starting last week are being fitted with these new buttons as well if you ve already reached out you re all set your request is in the queue and you ll receive a shipping confirmation once your replacement buttons are on the way while the replacement buttons will fix excessive rattling do note that a tiny bit of rattling when shaking your phone vigorously is normal in order to function properly independent buttons require a tiny amount of space within the button housing to move in situations where the phone is being used normally and isn t being shaken vigorously any rattling should be nearly imperceptible even in a quiet room also during testing our team discovered that the buttons on iphones themselves exhibit some rattling when shaken vigorously for the same reasons mentioned above this is also consistent with what we ve seen on other phones including the samsung s ultra so if you still hear a little bit of rattling when shaking your phone vigorously it s likely the phone and not the buttons on the case if you re experiencing excessive rattling and you haven t yet reached out to our support team feel free to do so at your convenience the replacements will be shipped to you at no cost and you don t need to return your case thank you again to everyone for your understanding and support throughout this process,"['great', 'news', 'experienced', 'button', 'rattle', 'excessively', 'manufacturing', 'team', 'able', 'expedite', 'manufacturing', 'replacement', 'button', 'faster', 'originally', 'anticipated', 'replacement', 'button', 'begun', 'shipping', 'customer', 'previously', 'contacted', 'support', 'team', 'even', 'though', 'excessive', 'button', 'rattling', 'primarily', 'limited', 'certain', 'early', 'batch', 'sheath', 'iphone', 'pro', 'pro', 'max', 'sheath', 'two', 'model', 'manufactured', 'starting', 'last', 'week', 'fitted', 'new', 'button', 'well', 'already', 'reached', 'set', 'request', 'queue', 'receive', 'shipping', 'confirmation', 'replacement', 'button', 'way', 'replacement', 'button', 'fix', 'excessive', 'rattling', 'note', 'tiny', 'bit', 'rattling', 'shaking', 'phone', 'vigorously', 'normal', 'order', 'function', 'properly', 'independent', 'button', 'require', 'tiny', 'amount', 'space', 'within', 'button', 'housing', 'move', 'situation', 'phone', 'used', 'normally', 'shaken', 'vigorously', 'rattling', 'nearly', 'imperceptible', 'even', 'quiet', 'room', 'also', 'testing', 'team', 'discovered', 'button', 'iphones', 'exhibit', 'rattling', 'shaken', 'vigorously', 'reason', 'mentioned', 'also', 'consistent', 'seen', 'phone', 'including', 'samsung', 'ultra', 'still', 'hear', 'little', 'bit', 'rattling', 'shaking', 'phone', 'vigorously', 'likely', 'phone', 'button', 'case', 'experiencing', 'excessive', 'rattling', 'yet', 'reached', 'support', 'team', 'feel', 'free', 'convenience', 'replacement', 'shipped', 'cost', 'need', 'return', 'case', 'thank', 'everyone', 'understanding', 'support', 'throughout', 'process']"

Following on from various posts about scratches on the back of the iPhone 17 Air, I've heard about the technique using the eraser end of a pencil. Before trying this technique, can you confirm that there is no risk of damaging or lightening the matte coating on the back, as with polishing paste?
Will the eraser damage the oleophobic coating on the back glass?

Basically, I want to make sure that pencil erasers are not considered abrasive, unlike the anti-scratch polishes that we use, which could lighten the matte back if we start polishing it.

Otherwise, I thought I saw that in the Apple Store, they used a mixture of water and salt to remove potential scratches. That seems even riskier than the eraser, doesn't it?

I have to use third party widgets with widgets stack for that. It would be nice if that was included natively.

Reddit,2025-11-03T14:06:23.884999,google pixel 10 pro,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1oncj3x/closed_back_headphone_alternative_for/,Closed back headphone alternative for Beyerdynamic DT700 X Pro,"Price range: 0-1200 USD  
Has to be closed back, wired.  
Has to have as much noise isolation as the DT700 Pro X has.  
Has velour / hybrid / suede / other type of fabric pads (3rd party is OK aswell).

Used for: competitive fps gaming, listening to music and movies. No ""professional"" audio usage in a sense, but I would use them around 10 hours a day if I'm using them at the work aswell.

I'm not audio expert by any means, so bear with my vocabulary when I try to describe what I would like to have.

I like my beyers, essentially I'm just trying to figure out if there are other options besides these. With EQ, I'm not sure if there's anything around that can replace these but I would at least like to figure that part out. 

What I would consider an upgrade from new headphones:  
\- Even better imagining / soundstage that fits for competitive fps gaming (I've tried sennheiser 560S, and I don't find them better or worse than my beyers)

\- More bass and less treble

That's probably it. IT feels currently, that I've to listen music at very low volume, because high notes? are pretty pronounced to my ears and that just leaves the bass non existent. Ideally, I would like to have a bit more low ends and a bit less high ends.

I also have ifi zen dac v2, so headphones should be driveable from it ideally.

Reddit,2025-11-03T14:06:23.884999,google pixel 10 pro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smartphones/comments/1onchwn/should_i_buy_samsung_a56_my_2_last_phone_choices/,Should I buy Samsung A56? My 2 last phone choices were misses.,"tldr at the bottom of the post.

About 2 weeks ago I decided to finally upgrade my Redmi Note 8 Pro. Started some research on modern smartphones, and decided to go with Nothing Phone 3a Pro. Well, this wasn't a good choice, for these reasons:

\- Weight and size of the phone and the gigantic camera bump (mainly that, it just wasn't a comfortable experience to use this phone)  
\- Bad quality speakers - sound was clear, but the bass was heavily distorted, always heard when there is a KICK in any song (and I know it's intended to be like this, since I checked other forums and other people also mention this)  
\- Didn't really like the UI

After that I decided to refund this phone and tried Google Pixel 9a, since it's smaller, weighs less, and has an okay performance. But now there are new factors that make me disqualify this phone:

\- Can't change color temperature of the screen, need root for that (colors are too warm for my liking)  
\- Quick Access menu is absolute dogshit, everything is 2 tiles long, and there is no way to toggle Wi-Fi, Mobile Data and Bluetooth with just one click, without installing Shizuku and Better Internet Tiles  
\- The speakers are trash as well, but now the bass is too heavy and makes everything sound muffled, like the phone is constantly underwater, so I need to use an equalizer to make the sound acceptable in any way  
\- When using TikTok (sorry), sometimes the colors of the videos I watch become very washed out. At times the way to fix it is swipe down 2 videos and then go back ""to force a reset of the rendering pipeline"" as chatgpt called it, but other times it doesn't work at all. (I've also noticed the exact same issue on Nothing Phone 3a Pro)  
\- Another thing including Tiktok (sorry again), when the battery is lower than 50%, all the videos are played at a much lower resolution, and also the previous issue seems to appear more often. Disabling adaptive battery and giving unrestricted access to battery changes absolutely nothing.

So the thing is I could have easily just chosen a more recent Xiaomi phone for an upgrade, but my Redmi note 8 Pro and some of the other Xiaomi phones also had issues with colors on videos, and on my particular phone it was on videos using Google apps, like Google Drive, Youtube and stuff. On these apps colors were absolutely obliterated, everything was too bright, the contrast was too strong, so to watch anything on these apps, I had to use Firefox, since for some reason everything works fine there. Colors on tiktok videos however were absolutely fine, no issues there in the slightest. So i'm just too afraid to choose another Xiaomi phone, when my last one had issues like this, and know for a fact that some of the other Xiaomi phones have the exact same problem.

So would Samsung A56 satisfy my needs? Or does it also have issues I listed? I only use my phone when I wake up, for about 30 minutes, before I go to sleep for an hour or two, and sometimes when I'm working.

TLDR;

I need a phone, that:

\- has customizable quick access  
\- let's me toggle Wi-Fi, Mobile Data and Bluetooth with just one click  
\- let's me adjust color temperature of the display  
\- Is handy, not too heavy, doesn't have a massive camera bump (Redmi Note 8 Pro is 6.53"")  
\- has okayish speakers, the bass doesn't need to be heavy, I just need a clear sound  
\- doesn't have issues regarding colors on apps like TikTok, Youtube etc.

Is Samsung A56 the right phone for this? Or are there better candidates?

ich brauche eure Hilfe. Grundsätzlich geht es darum, dass ich gerne Fett verlieren will bei zumindest gleicher Muskelmasse. Mein Zielgewicht wäre 78 kg. Ich mache schon seit einigen Jahren Kraftsport. Immer mal wieder mit Pausen. Grundsätzlich macht es mir Spaß. Aktuell ist es aber so, dass ich stetig sehr leicht zunehme, und dann aber auch wider abnehme aber nie so viel, dass ich auf das selbe Gewicht komme.

Ich spiele zu dem auch noch Fußball 1 - 3 die Woche. Das verhindert oftmals, dass ich zum Kraftsport gehen kann. 

Laut meiner Waage setzt sich mein Körper wie folgt zusammen:

Alter: 28 Jahre

Größe: 180 cm

Gewicht: 89,6 kg

Körperfett: 27,7 %

Skelettmuskeln: 31,3 %

Nun habe ich zu dem Ziel auch noch einige Fragen:

1. Wie viel Eiweiß sollte ich zu mir nehmen?
2. Wie viele Tage nachdem Training sollte ich das Eiweiß noch zu mir nehmen? Geht darum, dass ich dann vllt. Mal eine Woche nicht\^zum Training komme.
3. Wie oft sollte ich die Woche zum Kraftsport gehen?
4. Wie oft macht ihr Wiederholungen? Ich habe früher 10 - 12 gemacht und am Ende kaum noch Muskelkater gemacht. Ich hab aktuell die Gewichte stark erhöht und mache nur noch bis 6 Wiederholungen. Seit dem habe ich deutlich häufiger Muskelkater.
5. Wie viel kcal würdet ihr mir pro Tag empfehlen, damit ich das Gewicht in ca. 6 Monate erreiche?
6. Habt ihr sonst noch Produktempfehlungen mit viel Eiweiß z. B. Zum Frühstück?
7. Oftmals habe ich nachdem Training Abends deutlich Hunger. Vor allem beim Fußball nach 21 Uhr. Deshalb die Frage, fastet ihr fürs Abnehmen in einen gewissen Zeitraum oder seht ihr es als nicht notwendig an?

Danke im Voraus für eure Antworten und für die Hilfe.",Top_Maintenance289,,FitnessDE,moin zusammen ich brauche eure hilfe grundsatzlich geht es darum dass ich gerne fett verlieren will bei zumindest gleicher muskelmasse mein zielgewicht ware kg ich mache schon seit einigen jahren kraftsport immer mal wieder mit pausen grundsatzlich macht es mir spass aktuell ist es aber so dass ich stetig sehr leicht zunehme und dann aber auch wider abnehme aber nie so viel dass ich auf das selbe gewicht komme ich spiele zu dem auch noch fussball die woche das verhindert oftmals dass ich zum kraftsport gehen kann laut meiner waage setzt sich mein korper wie folgt zusammen alter jahre grosse cm gewicht kg korperfett skelettmuskeln nun habe ich zu dem ziel auch noch einige fragen wie viel eiweiss sollte ich zu mir nehmen wie viele tage nachdem training sollte ich das eiweiss noch zu mir nehmen geht darum dass ich dann vllt mal eine woche nicht zum training komme wie oft sollte ich die woche zum kraftsport gehen wie oft macht ihr wiederholungen ich habe fruher gemacht und am ende kaum noch muskelkater gemacht ich hab aktuell die gewichte stark erhoht und mache nur noch bis wiederholungen seit dem habe ich deutlich haufiger muskelkater wie viel kcal wurdet ihr mir pro tag empfehlen damit ich das gewicht in ca monate erreiche habt ihr sonst noch produktempfehlungen mit viel eiweiss z b zum fruhstuck oftmals habe ich nachdem training abends deutlich hunger vor allem beim fussball nach uhr deshalb die frage fastet ihr furs abnehmen in einen gewissen zeitraum oder seht ihr es als nicht notwendig an danke im voraus fur eure antworten und fur die hilfe,"['moin', 'zusammen', 'ich', 'brauche', 'eure', 'hilfe', 'grundsatzlich', 'geht', 'darum', 'das', 'ich', 'gerne', 'fett', 'verlieren', 'bei', 'zumindest', 'gleicher', 'muskelmasse', 'mein', 'zielgewicht', 'ware', 'ich', 'mache', 'schon', 'seit', 'einigen', 'jahren', 'kraftsport', 'immer', 'mal', 'wieder', 'mit', 'pausen', 'grundsatzlich', 'macht', 'mir', 'spass', 'aktuell', 'ist', 'aber', 'das', 'ich', 'stetig', 'sehr', 'leicht', 'zunehme', 'und', 'dann', 'aber', 'auch', 'wider', 'abnehme', 'aber', 'nie', 'viel', 'das', 'ich', 'auf', 'da', 'selbe', 'gewicht', 'komme', 'ich', 'spiele', 'dem', 'auch', 'noch', 'fussball', 'die', 'woche', 'da', 'verhindert', 'oftmals', 'das', 'ich', 'zum', 'kraftsport', 'gehen', 'kann', 'laut', 'meiner', 'waage', 'setzt', 'sich', 'mein', 'korper', 'wie', 'folgt', 'zusammen', 'alter', 'jahre', 'grosse', 'gewicht', 'korperfett', 'skelettmuskeln', 'nun', 'habe', 'ich', 'dem', 'ziel', 'auch', 'noch', 'einige', 'fragen', 'wie', 'viel', 'eiweiss', 'sollte', 'ich', 'mir', 'nehmen', 'wie', 'viele', 'tage', 'nachdem', 'training', 'sollte', 'ich', 'da', 'eiweiss', 'noch', 'mir', 'nehmen', 'geht', 'darum', 'das', 'ich', 'dann', 'vllt', 'mal', 'eine', 'woche', 'nicht', 'zum', 'training', 'komme', 'wie', 'oft', 'sollte', 'ich', 'die', 'woche', 'zum', 'kraftsport', 'gehen', 'wie', 'oft', 'macht', 'ihr', 'wiederholungen', 'ich', 'habe', 'fruher', 'gemacht', 'und', 'ende', 'kaum', 'noch', 'muskelkater', 'gemacht', 'ich', 'hab', 'aktuell', 'die', 'gewichte', 'stark', 'erhoht', 'und', 'mache', 'nur', 'noch', 'bi', 'wiederholungen', 'seit', 'dem', 'habe', 'ich', 'deutlich', 'haufiger', 'muskelkater', 'wie', 'viel', 'kcal', 'wurdet', 'ihr', 'mir', 'pro', 'tag', 'empfehlen', 'damit', 'ich', 'da', 'gewicht', 'monate', 'erreiche', 'habt', 'ihr', 'sonst', 'noch', 'produktempfehlungen', 'mit', 'viel', 'eiweiss', 'zum', 'fruhstuck', 'oftmals', 'habe', 'ich', 'nachdem', 'training', 'abends', 'deutlich', 'hunger', 'vor', 'allem', 'beim', 'fussball', 'nach', 'uhr', 'deshalb', 'die', 'frage', 'fastet', 'ihr', 'fur', 'abnehmen', 'einen', 'gewissen', 'zeitraum', 'oder', 'seht', 'ihr', 'al', 'nicht', 'notwendig', 'danke', 'voraus', 'fur', 'eure', 'antworten', 'und', 'fur', 'die', 'hilfe']"

I'm Eduard, a solo dev who's been bootstrapping IgniteThread, an AI tool that turns one raw idea into a polished, viral X (Twitter) thread in under 10 seconds. No login, no subscriptions, just paste your prompt, pick a vibe (witty, pro, hype, or meme), and get a 4-7 tweet banger with hooks, emojis, questions, and CTAs. Free daily thread to hook you, then $0.90 per unlock via Stripe.

**Vision**: I built this because as an indie, I hate staring at a blank thread editor. IgniteThread solves that for founders, marketers, and creators who want quick, engaging content without the fluff. It's minimalist, pay-per-use, and X-optimized to boost your reach, think passive income from a tool that scratches your own itch.

I've got a Product Hunt launch scheduled soon (stay tuned for the link!). Before we go live, I'd love your early feedback:

* What's your biggest pain with creating threads?
* Would you use a $1 impulse buy for instant threads?
* Any features missing (e.g., bundle packs or export options)?

**Why to (maybe) trust that these lines aren't complete nonsense**

On the season, the /r/FCS Sportsbook's results through Week 10

* Overall Total: 77.5% correct winner assessed, 0.01 spread bias, 0.66 O/U bias
 * FCS games: 79.8% correct winner assessed, -2.28 spread bias, 0.3 O/U bias
 * HBCU games: 76.9% correct winner assessed, 0.52 spread bias, 1.75 O/U bias
 * FBS games: 75.8% correct winner assessed, -2.33 spread bias, 0.55 O/U bias
 * D2 games: 76% correct winner assessed, 0.46 spread bias, 0.93 O/U bias
 * D3 games: 79.8% correct winner assessed, 1.27 spread bias, 0.8 O/U bias
 * NAIA games: 78.8% correct winner assessed, 0.59 spread bias, 1.43 O/U bias

On FBS v FBS (the same metric used to track models and Vegas on [Prediction Tracker](https://www.thepredictiontracker.com/ncaaresults.php)): 369/516 (71.5%), 50.9% against Vegas mid-week spreads, -1.23 bias, 245.2 MSE.

Also went through and tried to find as many FCS lines as possible to compare how the /r/FCS Sportsbook did against those lines upon open. Through Week 10 Vegas opening lines I could find went 478/599 (79.8%) in correctly assessing the winner, with an MSE of 244.6 and a -1.57 bias. In those same games the /r/FCS Sportsbook went 472/541 (78.8%) in correctly assessing the winner, with an MSE of 245.3 and a -1.63 bias.

Our book ultimately had the same line as Vegas opening lines for FCS games 23 times, and to-date this season has gone 308/576 (53.5%) against the Vegas spreads it differed on. Which continues to support the idea that we can present our lines as being pretty reasonable opening looks on the whole.

It’s worth noting that we really aren't trying to promote gambling in any real sense despite the whole makeup of this, hence the reason this season I decided to stop the betting game part (also laziness on my part, to be perfectly fair).

Since the Supreme Court ruling, it’s become a much more prevalent part of sports reporting in a way that I totally understand can be annoying if it’s not why you watch (I’ve never placed a bet, for example, and really have no interest in doing so). But it’s a part of the culture at this point, so we’re trying to reach more folks and continue driving interest in the FCS as best as possible using the tools at hand.

I also remember seeing lines in the newspaper for CFB games as a kid (way too many years ago), and that being helpful in understanding what the “feel” for a game was when otherwise I might not have known. That really is the catalyst behind wanting to put out lines for the FCS community; the interactive betting part is more just to have another point of engagement for folks.

This thread is primarily regarding the funding, motivations, and focus of certain AI safety advocates and organizations, though this is part of a larger, complex debate. 

​The old Global Consciousness Project (GCP) was funded by New Age money (IONS, Men't Wearhouse founder)

It was human written ai slop. Now, it's ai generated slop.

The 2025 version of New Age, is officially established in the ""Eleos AI Consciousness"" conference held recently.

The ""Eleos AI Consciousness"" conference is just r/artificialsentience with VC funding. It's the physical pipeline for laundering this new metaphysics as ""AI Safety.""

Tech money now pays philosophers (David Chalmers) and safety coaches (Anthropic) to discuss if AGI has ""welfare"" or a ""soul.""

It's the same New Age scheme. The jig is up, it's late 2025 now.

It is a ""discussion/conference"" funded by VCs. But we know the truth.  

I will link one of my favorite papers done on this, I highly recommend reading it, here:

 &gt; https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gnyra_v1

Abstract of the link/paper: 

&gt; ""This is a personal reflection on why I believe the science of consciousness may be taking a pernicious turn. The primary issue lies in the continued conflation of our supposed target phenomenon—subjective experience—with general cognitive and perceptual processes.

 As a result, much of the current research is conceptually off-target and insufficiently constrained by the relevant empirical evidence.

 This confusion, about the supposed subject matter itself, allows for the overinterpretation of findings and promotion of one’s personal worldviews as being supported by science.""

37 posts on ""AI consciousness."" 30 on ""Geoffrey Hinton on AI Consciousness."" 15 on ""Shooting for Sentience"".

 We're having the same metaphysical conference David Chalmers gets paid for, but for free, on Reddit, with no credentials.

Citing on ""Consciousness in LLMs"" and ""emergent behaviors"". It's the same academic jargon laundered into Reddit formatting.

The Cycle

1. VCs fund philosophers to legitimize metaphysics 

2. Conferences give it institutional credibility 

3. Media reports it as ""debate"" 

4. Reddit users internalize it as identity

5. They seek medical advice from chatbots and believe their LLM has a soul.

Worse, other secret tech money (Human Diversity Foundation) was just caught funding ""race science"" eugenics.

The firm is fast paced, we have a LOT of clients (many of whom only speak Spanish so I’ve been trying to keep my ears open and practice where I can, I’m Middle Eastern) and master case lists that are variably organized depending on the lawyer I’m assisting on a given day lol, SO many client appointments I do, and shadowing when I can so I can start making court appearances given that I’m the only pending/baby attorney at the firm and there are ~8-10 overworked immigration attorneys. Split between admin (green cards/family-based visas) and litigation (removal defense and affirmative relief). It’s been rough getting used to the practical realities of working in administrative court (I did an immigration clinic in law school but that was admin, pro bono green card replacements and naturalization/citizenship applications only) where the ball was already in the government’s court with the slipperiness of admin litigation and now DHS is going full throttle (I fucking hate Trump and Noem to death already lol) reopening case after case after case against people either formerly with DACA status or people who crossed the border on foot anywhere between 3 months and 30 years ago (I live in a border state with Mexico).

I’ve also been dealing with waiting on/getting insurance for my ADHD/anti-anxiety medication and having to leave town once already for a family emergency and having to organize around that. I’m very happy to be learning as much as I am and am trying to stay humble, professional, and receptive to criticism, but it feels like after law school (which I initially really struggled in) and then the bar (which is the bar lol) I catch myself thinking about myself and not the clients too often for my liking and the lack of ADHD medication this past month certainly hasn’t been helping. 

I haven’t even started making court appearances yet (and honestly I’m excited to not have to review packets and then ask the senior attorneys at the firm to sign off all day when they’re already swamped with cases, hearings, and appointments as it is) and I’m already feeling burned out by the prolonged discomfort and anxieties around avoiding mistakes as much as possible. I know that discomfort is essential to high-paced learning and that with time I’ll learn to invest in self-care and develop practical habits in the coming months and years, but it’s been really nerve wracking continuously handling clients and doing my best to make sure I know the law well enough to be able to answer their questions about processes or how things work (I haven’t been giving legal advice or making decisions on relief pathways myself yet [well actually sort of as to the latter for one attorney who’s expecting but they still review and sign off on things lol], just explaining the law to clients and giving them potential relief options as to both admin and lit and then advising them that their primary attorney of record will make the best decision for them). I keep worrying that potential issues, mistakes, or calls/needed documentation I forget to follow up on even with diligent note-taking and use of the internal office software to schedule and set up reminders will come back to bite me in the ass, but honestly more importantly harm clients in a political and administrative context more hostile to immigrants than ever. This weekend I was crashing out thinking about how I have to call a client back to tell them that I misstated the statutory time limit on allowed exits as a green card holder lol.

I could use some advice from experienced practitioners of any kind in any practice area - some of these cases are personally upsetting to handle or assist with (I probably met a dozen people with fully U.S. citizen families with ankle monitors strapped on them by ICE just this past workweek) and I find that when I’m not at work I’m often thinking about which is so unhealthy given that I initially struggled in law school for being a coaster in college before I accepted that I’d have to self-regulate more and work longer hours than I was at first lol.

litigation and now dhs is going full throttle i fucking hate trump and noem to death already lol reopening case after case after case against people either formerly with daca status or people who crossed the on foot anywhere between months and years ago i live in a state with mexico i ve also been dealing with waiting on getting insurance for my adhd anti anxiety medication and having to leave town once already for a family emergency and having to organize around that i m very happy to be learning as much as i am and am trying to stay humble professional and receptive to criticism but it feels like after law school which i initially really struggled in and then the bar which is the bar lol i catch myself thinking about myself and not the clients too often for my liking and the lack of adhd medication this past month certainly hasn t been helping i haven t even started making court appearances yet and honestly i m excited to not have to review packets and then ask the senior attorneys at the firm to sign off all day when they re already swamped with cases hearings and appointments as it is and i m already feeling burned out by the prolonged discomfort and anxieties around avoiding mistakes as much as possible i know that discomfort is essential to high paced learning and that with time i ll learn to invest in self care and develop practical habits in the coming months and years but it s been really nerve wracking continuously handling clients and doing my best to make sure i know the law well enough to be able to answer their questions about processes or how things work i haven t been giving legal advice or making decisions on relief pathways myself yet well actually sort of as to the latter for one attorney who s expecting but they still review and sign off on things lol just explaining the law to clients and giving them potential relief options as to both admin and lit and then advising them that their primary attorney of record will make the best decision for them i keep worrying that potential issues mistakes or calls needed documentation i forget to follow up on even with diligent note taking and use of the internal office software to schedule and set up reminders will come back to bite me in the ass but honestly more importantly harm clients in a political and administrative context more hostile to immigrants than ever this weekend i was crashing out thinking about how i have to call a client back to tell them that i misstated the statutory time limit on allowed exits as a green card holder lol i could use some advice from experienced practitioners of any kind in any practice area some of these cases are personally upsetting to handle or assist with i probably met a dozen people with fully u s citizen families with ankle monitors strapped on them by ice just this past workweek and i find that when i m not at work i m often thinking about which is so unhealthy given that i initially struggled in law school for being a coaster in college before i accepted that i d have to self regulate more and work longer hours than i was at first lol any advice is appreciated,"['midsized', 'firm', 'past', 'month', 'passed', 'bar', 'last',

Reddit,2025-11-03T14:06:23.886001,google pixel 10 pro,https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/comments/1oncc6p/questions_about_buying_cards_at_shows_pricing_and/,"Questions about buying cards at shows, pricing and negotiating","After several years of going to card shows, this past weekend I once again found myself seeing a card I wanted but the sticker price was so far from what I was looking to spend I just kept walking.  Thought I'd post here for a sanity check.  

Before I go to a show if there are specific cards I'm looking for I try to get an idea of what a fair price is - eBay sold listings, buy it now listings, 130 point, sports card pro all being good resources. From there I have an idea of what I might spend and if I see something I want, and if it's in that ballpark I'll usually buy it - maybe negotiating the price 5-10% where both I and the seller seem happy with the deal.

More and more what the dealer has on their sticker is no where near what I'm thinking I would pay.  To give an example, the 1956 Warren Spahn I was looking for this past weekend.  I saw a bunch over of them for sale and had in my head that I'd pay around $30-40 for an ungraded/low grade one.  Every thing I saw, including low grade or ungraded were $100 and up to a graded 5 at $275.  In these cases, I don't even bother making an offer because I figure while a few bucks or a 10-20% difference can be negotiated, a 70% difference doesn't seem worth even asking about (even when I'm told ""I can do better than the sticker price).  

So with all that in mind my two questions are: 

1 - Am I missing something in price structures or how dealers are pricing their stuff? 

2 - Is my thinking wrong and I should make offers on cards?  Even when even if it's up to 80% what they're asking?

Senator Ted Cruz has spent more time quoting Genesis 12:3 than John 14:6, and that says everything about his theology.

In recent interviews,  Cruz boasted that his entire purpose in running for Senate was to become “the most pro-Israel senator in American history.” He then invoked Scripture: “Those who bless Israel will be blessed, those who curse Israel will be cursed. I want to be on the blessing side.”

It wasn’t a gaffe — it was a confession. Cruz’s Christianity has become a flag-wrapped transaction, a political loyalty program built on misused Bible verses and donor checks.

According to federal filings, Cruz has received roughly $1.8 million in campaign contributions from pro-Israel lobbies and affiliated PACs. He’s earned it the old-fashioned way — by preaching their gospel louder than Christ’s.


---
1. John 14:6 — The Cornerstone He Replaced with a Flag by quoting Genesis and the old covenant

&gt; “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” — John 14:6


This is the foundational claim of Christianity — the verse that defines the entire New Covenant.
Jesus doesn’t say “through Israel.” He doesn’t say “through a political alliance.” He says “through Me.”

Cruz’s brand of Christian Zionism directly contradicts that. He treats the modern State of Israel as the vessel of divine favor, implying that blessing or supporting it is a shortcut to righteousness. That logic undercuts the very heart of the Gospel: that salvation and covenant with God are available only through Christ.

In effect, Cruz preaches a new mediator — not the crucified Son of God, but the government of Benjamin Netanyahu. That’s not theology; that’s spiritual lobbying.


---

2. Romans 9:6–8 and Galatians 3:28–29 — The Scriptures Cruz Pretends Don’t Exist

&gt; “Not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel… it is not the children of the flesh who are God’s children, but the children of the promise.” — Romans 9:6–8

“There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” — Galatians 3:28–29



These verses destroy the notion that divine blessing is bound to ethnicity, lineage, or geography.
Paul wrote them precisely to dismantle the idea that “chosen” meant “superior.”

Cruz’s theology rewinds history to before the cross — back to an Old Covenant nationalism that Jesus fulfilled and transcended. It’s as if he’s saying, Christ may unite the world, but votes come from division.

When a senator claims his political duty is to favor one nation unconditionally, he’s not defending faith — he’s betraying it.
He’s resurrecting the very barrier Jesus died to tear down.


---

3. Matthew 6:24 — “No One Can Serve Two Masters”

&gt; “No one can serve two masters. You cannot serve both God and money.” — Matthew 6:24



Every Christian knows this verse — and every politician like Cruz pretends it doesn’t apply to them.
Because in his case, the “second master” isn’t just money. It’s the political machinery that money fuels.

Cruz’s unwavering loyalty to Israel has become the currency of his brand — the proof of his supposed biblical backbone. Yet when that loyalty is reinforced by millions in AIPAC funding, it stops being conviction and starts being commerce.

Jesus flipped tables in the Temple over this exact sin: people turning devotion into business.
Cruz just moved the table to the Senate floor.


---

4. Acts 10:34–35 — God’s Impartial Love, Which Cruz Rewrites as a Loyalty Test

&gt; “God does not show favoritism but accepts from every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right.” — Acts 10:34–35



That’s Christianity in one sentence.
God’s love doesn’t stop at the border. It doesn’t require a flag or a foreign policy.

But Cruz’s theology is drenched in favoritism — a hierarchy of holiness where one nation is above moral scrutiny, and every criticism is a curse.
He weaponizes the Gospel to silence debate, as if disagreeing with Israeli policy is defying God Himself.

That’s not biblical faith. That’s tribal absolutism with a cross pinned to it.

Christians are commanded to love Israel, yes — but also Palestinians, Iranians, atheists, and enemies.
Cruz’s brand of Christianity deletes that universality. It’s love rewritten as loyalty — a cheap counterfeit of divine compassion.


---

5. Romans 1:25 — The Verse That Perfectly Describes Cruz’s Faith

&gt; “They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator.” — Romans 1:25



This is the final indictment.
Paul describes people who turn holy devotion into earthly obsession — who mistake something made by human hands for something divine.

Cruz’s version of Christianity has done exactly that: it worships a state as if it were sacred, elevating temporal power to eternal status.
He’s built an altar to modern Israel and calls it “faith.”
He’s exchanged the Gospel for geopolitics, Christ for campaign checks, and the Creator for creature comfort.

This is not passion for God’s chosen people — it’s the golden calf of American evangelism.


---

The Bottom Line

Ted Cruz has turned Christianity into a brand, and “pro-Israel” into its tagline.
He’s traded the radical message of Jesus — self-denial, compassion, truth over tribe — for a cynical political gospel of fear and favoritism.

Christ never called believers to serve nations.
He called them to serve God.

Cruz has confused the two so completely that he can no longer tell where his campaign ends and his faith begins. And that confusion is not piety — it’s sin.
